Lin is a open source plug-in for **Xcode 5**.  
It lets you search/manage localizations without opening the .strings files.

## Features
When you are focusing on NSLocalizedString or other functions to get a localized version of a string, Lin shows the list of localizations that contains the inputted key string.

You can add a new localization or remove a localization from the popover.  
(Click +/- button in the bottom left of the popover.)

You can also edit key or value of a localization by clicking the row on the table.

Lin has not only popover mode, but also window mode.  
The window will appear when you drag-and-drop the popover.  
In window mode, the search field can be used to find the localization with a free keyword.
